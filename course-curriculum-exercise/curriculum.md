COURSE GOALS
After completing the course, you will be able to:
KNOWLEDGE

K1 Explain the web development ecosystem when building
functional, user-friendly, and accessible websites.

SKILL S2 Critically evaluate the use of AI coding assistants to support
frontend development, ensuring outputs align with functionality,
accuracy, and best practices.

SKILL S3 Build interactive, data-driven web interfaces using JavaScript to

create responsive, user-focused experiences.

SKILL S4 Collaborate on codebases using Git and GitHub to manage
changes, maintain quality, and support shared development
workflows.

PURPOSE AND CONTENT OF THE COURSE
In this course, you will build a solid foundation in frontend development by learning
how websites are structured, styled, and made interactive. You will use HTML and CSS
to organise content and design responsive layouts, and begin using JavaScript to create

dynamic, data-driven user experiences.
You will gain hands-on experience with core techniques like DOM manipulation, event
handling, and working with APIs and client-side storage. You will also practise working
collaboratively in codebases using Git and GitHub, applying best practices in version
control.
As part of your modern development workflow, you will explore how to use AI coding
assistants and learn how to critically evaluate their output to ensure code quality.

COURSE ASSESSMENT: FORMATS AND GRADES

‘PASS WITH DISTINCTION’

Submission K1 Explain the web
development ecosystem
when building functional,
user-friendly, and accessible
websites.

Submission S2 Critically evaluate the use
of AI coding assistants to
support frontend
development, ensuring
outputs align with
functionality, accuracy, and
best practices.
Submission S3 Build interactive,
data-driven web interfaces
using JavaScript to create
responsive, user-focused
experiences.

S3 You will receive a Pass with
Distinction (PWD) if your
JavaScript implementation
demonstrates clear structure,
effective interaction logic, and
thoughtful design decisions that
result in a responsive,
user-focused experience.

Submission S4 Collaborate on codebases
using Git and GitHub to
manage changes, maintain
quality, and support shared
development workflows.

ASSESSMENT PRINCIPLES
The following grading scale shall be used when the course is completed:
IG = Icke Godkänd (No Pass)
G = Godkänd (Pass)
VG = Väl Godkänd (Pass with distinction)
- If you are assessed as not having achieved all the course goals in the course, you are
awarded the grade IG (No Pass) for that course.
- If you are assessed to have achieved all the course goals in the course, you are
awarded the grade G (Pass) for that course.
- If you are assessed to have achieved all the course goals in the course, and have shown
that you satisfy all the criteria for Pass with Distinction (see above table), you are
awarded the grade VG (Pass with Distinction) for that course.
If you have not achieved one or several course goals or have been absent during
regular assessment, you will be reassessed as follows:
Reassessment
If you don’t pass the course, you can reassess, following the format outlined in the
curriculum.
The guidelines for reassessment are as follows:

1. You can reassess the course goals you did not achieve if you are awarded a NO
PASS or there is no basis for grading due to absence.
2. The reassessment will take place within a reasonable time after the course grade
was given.
3. There will be one ordinary reassessment and one collective reassessment date
within 3 months after the ordinary graduation date.
If you still have a “No Pass” as a course grade 3 months after the end of the program, we
can not guarantee a formal graduation.
