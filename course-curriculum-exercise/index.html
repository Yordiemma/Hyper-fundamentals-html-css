    <h2>PURPOSE AND CONTENT OF THE COURSE</h2>
    <p>
      In this course, you will build a solid foundation in frontend development
      by learning how websites are structured, styled, and made interactive. You
      will use HTML and CSS to organise content and design responsive layouts,
      and begin using JavaScript to create dynamic, data-driven user
      experiences.
    </p>
    <p>dynamic, data-driven user experience</p>
    <p>
      You will gain hands-on experience with core techniques like DOM
      manipulation, event handling, and working with APIs and client-side
      storage. You will also practise working collaboratively in codebases using
      Git and GitHub, applying best practices in version control.
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of your modern development workflow, you will explore how to use
      AI coding assistants and learn how to critically evaluate their output to
      ensure code quality.
